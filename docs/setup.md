# Setup
Out of the box, TagMonster supports only data on the local filesystem for both input and output. If you would like to use any of the remote data sources or targets, you will need to set up credentials. 

When you are done, head to the [usage page](docs/usage.md)

## GenEq workers only
Request the "settings file" your team lead. It contains a data set in JSON format, like `"data": "Value"`. In TagMonster, click on Program Settings and copy and paste the Values (do *not* include the quotation marks) into the appropriate text boxes. They will be in the same order. Finally, click both buttons and sign in to the same accounts you use for the archive project.
