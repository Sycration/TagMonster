# Usage
TagMonster manages data in the form of "projects", each of which corresponds to a single stable source of non-changing data. One person should be responsible for one project. 

## Creating a project
On the TagMonster home screen, click the `Create Project...` button on the right. A pop-up window will open. Select your desired data *source* from the buttons at the top of the new window. If it is grayed out, you will have to go back to `Program Settings` on the main window and sign in to your desired source.

If you are working with `local` data, press the Select button and select the folder where your data is.
