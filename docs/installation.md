# Installation
If you are a regular user, you should download the **binary** release. If you are a developer, you should download the **source code**.

Once installed, head to the [setup page](docs/setup.md)

## Binary installation
Navigate to [https://github.com/Sycration/TagMonster/releases/latest](https://github.com/Sycration/TagMonster/releases/latest) and download the right binary for your machine from the Assets section. Always download the latest version.

### MacOS
1. MacOS users should download the file that ends in `.app.zip`. 
2. Extract the zip file to your downloads folder. It will create a application folder called `TagMonster [VERSION].app`.

4. In Finder, navigate to your downloads folder.
5. Drag the `TagMonster [VERSION].app` out of finder and release it over your terminal window. Do not close the finder window.
6. Click on your terminal and press the return key. It may ask you for your password, if so enter it and press the return key again.
7. Return to Finder and open a new window (`File > New Finder Window` in the top bar).
8. In the new window, navigate to your applications folder.
9. Drag the `TagMonster [VERSION].app` from your downloads folder into your applications folder. It may ask you for your password or some other confirmation; do so.
