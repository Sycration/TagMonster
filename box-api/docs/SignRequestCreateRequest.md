**signers** | [**Vec<models::SignRequestCreateSigner>**](SignRequestCreateSigner.md) | Array of signers for the signature request. 35 is the max number of signers permitted.  **Note**: It may happen that some signers belong to conflicting [segments](r://shield-information-barrier-segment-member) (user groups). This means that due to the security policies, users are assigned to segments to prevent exchanges or communication that could lead to ethical conflicts. In such a case, an attempt to send the sign request will result in an error.  Read more about [segments and ethical walls](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/9920431507603-Understanding-Information-Barriers#h_01GFVJEHQA06N7XEZ4GCZ9GFAQ). |

The root folder, folder ID `0`, cannot be used and can also not be null.  When this value is not passed in when the signature request, then we will use a default folder which is either the parent folder of the first source file in the payload if we have the permission to upload to that folder or a folder called \"My Sign Requests\". | [optional]
