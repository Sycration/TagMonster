## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | The unique identifier that represent a file.  The ID for any file can be determined by visiting a file in the web application and copying the ID from the URL. For example, for the URL `https://_*.app.box.com/files/123` the `file_id` is `123`. | 
**etag** | Option<**String**> | The HTTP `etag` of this file. This can be used within some API endpoints in the `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` headers to only perform changes on the file if (no) changes have happened. | [optional]
**r#type** | **String** | The value will always be `file`. | 
**sequence_id** | Option<**String**> | A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event that has been applied to this item.  This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint to filter out user events that would have occurred before this identifier was read.  An example would be where a Box Drive-like application would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming user events for changes to the item. The application would ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally fetched resource. | [optional]
**name** | Option<**String**> | The name of the file. | [optional]
**sha1** | Option<**String**> | The SHA1 hash of the file. | [optional]
**file_version** | Option<[**models::FileVersionMini**](FileVersion--Mini.md)> |  | [optional]
